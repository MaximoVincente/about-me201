        <p>Hello everyone! My name is Maximo (he/him), and I live in Philadelphia, PA.
        I am currently a US Army active duty soldier, preparing to transition into the civilian world as a Software Engineer at
        the end of 2023. I am also working on my B.S in Computer Science, although it has been challenging, I enjoy CS very
        much. I have been in the military service for nine years, and experience working at every organizational level. I have three years of
        experience mentoring units with decision making process, organizational management, and occupational specialties, to
        guarantee the mission's success, and the organization's intent. Additionally, I have worked with many softwares used in military systems. 
        Looking forward to meet you!
